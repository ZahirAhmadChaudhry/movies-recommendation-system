There are three main types of recommendation systems:\n","\n","- Content-based: This type of system recommends items or content that are similar to the ones the user has liked, rated, or interacted with in the past. The system uses the features or attributes of the items or content to measure their similarity and rank them accordingly. For example, a content-based system can recommend movies to a user based on the genres, actors, directors, or ratings of the movies they have watched before.\n","\n","- Collaborative filtering: This type of system recommends items or content that are popular or liked by other users who have similar tastes or preferences as the current user. The system uses the ratings, feedback, or actions of the users to learn their preferences and predict what they will like. For example, a collaborative filtering system can recommend books to a user based on the books that other users with similar reading habits have enjoyed.\n","\n","- Hybrid: This type of system combines the strengths of both content-based and collaborative filtering systems to overcome their limitations and provide more accurate and diverse recommendations. The system can use different methods to integrate the two approaches, such as weighted voting, feature augmentation, or model blending. For example, a hybrid system can recommend music to a user based on both the features of the songs (such as genre, artist, or mood) and the ratings or playlists of other users who have similar music tastes.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-21T12:32:55.394360Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-21T12:32:55.393741Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-21T12:32:55.415999Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-21T12:32:55.414664Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-21T12:32:55.394257Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["#

As we are creating a content based recommendation system, we have to create tags for each movie. So, to select the columns that are useful for our model, we simply have to ask one question while looking at each column — Is this column useful for creating tags? Based on this, we have selected the following columns:\n","\n","i. Budget: Suppose I like a movie and its budget was high, it does not mean that I will like another movie whose budget is high. So, budget is not useful.\n","\n","ii. Genres: It is important. We usually get recommendations based on our favorite genres from our friends.\n","\n","iii. Homepage: It is not important.\n","\n","iv. ID: Yes, it will help us to extract posters for our website.\n","\n","v. Keyword: Important. These are tags.\n","\n","vi. Original language: We can see that 4510 data points are of English language, so this column is highly imbalanced and does not contribute much to a better recommendation model.\n","\n","vii. Original_title: We will keep the title column and remove the original_title, because the original title could be in the native language of the movie, but the title will be in English.\n","\n","viii. Overview: If the summary of two movies is similar, then the movies are also similar. So, overview is very important.\n","\n","ix. Popularity: As we are going to create tags for our model, and popularity is a numeric value, so it is not compatible with our approach.\n","\n","x. Production_Company: We usually do not recommend movies based on production companies. So, I do not think it is an important factor for a recommendation system.\n","\n","xi. Production_countries: As stated in point x, it also does not matter.\n","\n","xii. Release_date: Very important, but again a numeric value. Currently skipped. But, later I will figure out how to incorporate it in this scenario.\n","\n","xiii. Revenue: Does not matter.\n","\n","xiv. Runtime: Does not matter.\n","\n","xv. Spoken_languages: I think the story matters more than the spoken languages. I know some French people who watch Urdu dramas with English subtitles.\n","\n","xvi. Status: Released or upcoming. I think it does not matter. While sometimes it matters for the person who is searching for a good movie on Saturday night, but it does not matter for the recommendation system. Sometimes I have seen people only looking for upcoming movies. So, building a personalized recommendation system is out of the scope of this project.\n","\n","xvii. Tagline: Often taglines do not serve the purpose. As we already have the overview, the tagline could be skipped.\n","\n","xviii. Title: Yes, as discussed in original_title.\n","\n","xix. Vote_average: Numeric.\n","\n","xx. Vote_count: Numeric.\n","\n","xxi. Movie_id: Numeric. Also, we already have the ID.\n","\n","xxii. Cast: Very important. We like to watch movies of our favorite actors/actresses. Even if the movie is not good enough.\n","\n","xxiii. Crew: Very important. We like to watch movies from some directors. Even if the movie is not good enough."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-21T12:36:41.393733Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-21T12:36:41.393326Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-21T12:36:41.406883Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-21T12:36:41.405822Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-21T12:36:41.393699Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["#

represents.\n","\n","The reason why you need to use `ast.literal_eval` instead of the built-in `eval` function is that `eval` can execute any arbitrary Python code, which can be dangerous if the
