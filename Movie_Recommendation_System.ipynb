There are three main types of recommendation systems:\n","\n","- Content-based: This type of system recommends items or content that are similar to the ones the user has liked, rated, or interacted with in the past. The system uses the features or attributes of the items or content to measure their similarity and rank them accordingly. For example, a content-based system can recommend movies to a user based on the genres, actors, directors, or ratings of the movies they have watched before.\n","\n","- Collaborative filtering: This type of system recommends items or content that are popular or liked by other users who have similar tastes or preferences as the current user. The system uses the ratings, feedback, or actions of the users to learn their preferences and predict what they will like. For example, a collaborative filtering system can recommend books to a user based on the books that other users with similar reading habits have enjoyed.\n","\n","- Hybrid: This type of system combines the strengths of both content-based and collaborative filtering systems to overcome their limitations and provide more accurate and diverse recommendations. The system can use different methods to integrate the two approaches, such as weighted voting, feature augmentation, or model blending. For example, a hybrid system can recommend music to a user based on both the features of the songs (such as genre, artist, or mood) and the ratings or playlists of other users who have similar music tastes.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-21T12:32:55.394360Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-21T12:32:55.393741Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-21T12:32:55.415999Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-21T12:32:55.414664Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-21T12:32:55.394257Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["#

As we are creating a content based recommendation system, we have to create tags for each movie. So, to select the columns that are useful for our model, we simply have to ask one question while looking at each column — Is this column useful for creating tags? Based on this, we have selected the following columns:\n","\n","i. Budget: Suppose I like a movie and its budget was high, it does not mean that I will like another movie whose budget is high. So, budget is not useful.\n","\n","ii. Genres: It is important. We usually get recommendations based on our favorite genres from our friends.\n","\n","iii. Homepage: It is not important.\n","\n","iv. ID: Yes, it will help us to extract posters for our website.\n","\n","v. Keyword: Important. These are tags.\n","\n","vi. Original language: We can see that 4510 data points are of English language, so this column is highly imbalanced and does not contribute much to a better recommendation model.\n","\n","vii. Original_title: We will keep the title column and remove the original_title, because the original title could be in the native language of the movie, but the title will be in English.\n","\n","viii. Overview: If the summary of two movies is similar, then the movies are also similar. So, overview is very important.\n","\n","ix. Popularity: As we are going to create tags for our model, and popularity is a numeric value, so it is not compatible with our approach.\n","\n","x. Production_Company: We usually do not recommend movies based on production companies. So, I do not think it is an important factor for a recommendation system.\n","\n","xi. Production_countries: As stated in point x, it also does not matter.\n","\n","xii. Release_date: Very important, but again a numeric value. Currently skipped. But, later I will figure out how to incorporate it in this scenario.\n","\n","xiii. Revenue: Does not matter.\n","\n","xiv. Runtime: Does not matter.\n","\n","xv. Spoken_languages: I think the story matters more than the spoken languages. I know some French people who watch Urdu dramas with English subtitles.\n","\n","xvi. Status: Released or upcoming. I think it does not matter. While sometimes it matters for the person who is searching for a good movie on Saturday night, but it does not matter for the recommendation system. Sometimes I have seen people only looking for upcoming movies. So, building a personalized recommendation system is out of the scope of this project.\n","\n","xvii. Tagline: Often taglines do not serve the purpose. As we already have the overview, the tagline could be skipped.\n","\n","xviii. Title: Yes, as discussed in original_title.\n","\n","xix. Vote_average: Numeric.\n","\n","xx. Vote_count: Numeric.\n","\n","xxi. Movie_id: Numeric. Also, we already have the ID.\n","\n","xxii. Cast: Very important. We like to watch movies of our favorite actors/actresses. Even if the movie is not good enough.\n","\n","xxiii. Crew: Very important. We like to watch movies from some directors. Even if the movie is not good enough."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-21T12:36:41.393733Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-21T12:36:41.393326Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-21T12:36:41.406883Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-21T12:36:41.405822Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-21T12:36:41.393699Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["#

represents.\n","\n","The reason why you need to use `ast.literal_eval` instead of the built-in `eval` function is that `eval` can execute any arbitrary Python code, which can be dangerous if the

not ideal because it measures the straight-line distance between two points (tip to tip). This method is sensitive to the magnitude of the vectors, meaning that movies with different numbers of tags or varying tag importance could end up being far apart, even if they share similar themes or concepts. Euclidean distance doesn't capture the similarity in direction between the vectors, so two movies that are semantically similar but have varying levels of tag importance could be considered distant.\n","\n","Instead, we use **cosine distance** (or cosine similarity) because it measures the angle between the two vectors, not the magnitude. This technique focuses on the direction of the vectors, making it more suitable for comparing text-based data like movie tags. Cosine distance values range from 0 to 1, where 0 means the vectors are identical in direction (high similarity) and 1 means they are orthogonal (completely different). By using cosine distance, we can compare how closely aligned the tags are between movies, regardless of how many tags each movie has or their magnitudes, leading to more meaningful comparisons in recommendation systems."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":39,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n","\n","similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(vector)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":40,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["(4806, 4806)"]},"execution_count":40,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["similarity_matrix.shape"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":41,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["array([1.        , 0.02304335, 0.01284023, ..., 0.00565329, 0.00625386,\n","       0.        ])"]},"execution_count":41,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["similarity_matrix[0]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":42,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["def recommend(movie, num_recommendations=5):\n","    if movie not in movies['title'].values:\n","        print(\"Movie not found in the dataset\")\n","        return\n","    \n","    # Get the index of the movie\n","    index = movies[movies['title'] == movie].index[0]\n","    distances = similarity_matrix[index]\n","    \n","    # Get movie indices and sort them based on similarity score\n","    movies_index_list = sorted(list(enumerate(distances)), reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[1])[1:num_recommendations+1]\n","    \n","    # Display recommended movies along with their similarity score\n","    for i in movies_index_list:\n","        recommended_movie = movies.iloc[i[0]].title\n","        similarity_score = i[1]\n","        print(f\"Movie: {recommended_movie}, Similarity Score: {similarity_score:.2f}\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":43,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Movie: No Reservations, Similarity Score: 0.27\n","Movie: Burnt, Similarity Score: 0.24\n","Movie: Simply Irresistible, Similarity Score: 0.23\n","Movie: Flushed Away, Similarity Score: 0.19\n","Movie: The Hundred-Foot Journey, Similarity Score: 0.19\n"]}],"source":["recommend('Ratatouille')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Testing"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":44,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Precision at K: 0.4\n"]}],"source":["# Function to calculate Precision at K\n","def precision_at_k(recommended_movies, actual_movies, k=5):\n","    relevant = 0\n","    for movie in recommended_movies[:k]:\n","        if movie in actual_movies:\n","            relevant += 1\n","    precision = relevant / k\n","    return precision\n","\n","# Function to get recommendations and return as a list\n","def get_recommendations(movie, num_recommendations=5):\n","    if movie not in movies['title'].values:\n","        print(\"Movie not found in the dataset\")\n","        return []\n","    \n","    index = movies[movies['title'] == movie].index[0]\n","    distances = similarity_matrix[index]\n","    \n","    # Get movie indices and sort them based on similarity score\n","    movies_index_list = sorted(list(enumerate(distances)), reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[1])[1:num_recommendations+1]\n","    \n","    # Return list of recommended movie titles\n","    recommended_movies = [movies.iloc[i[0]].title for i in movies_index_list]\n","    return recommended_movies\n","\n","# test case: Actual relevant movies (ground truth) for 'Ratatouille'\n","actual_relevant_movies = ['The Master of Disguise', 'Simply Irresistible', 'Flushed Away']\n","\n","# Get recommended movies for 'Ratatouille'\n","recommended_movies = get_recommendations('Ratatouille', num_recommendations=6)\n","\n","# Calculate Precision at K\n","precision = precision_at_k(recommended_movies, actual_relevant_movies, k=5)\n","print(f'Precision at K: {precision}')\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":".venv","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
